# OrderedArrayList

Discussion:
  We need to use super() for the default version of NoNullArrayLists<T>.
  We for the version with super(startingCapacity) for the version of NoNullArrayLists with a starting capacity.
  We also noted that we should use super.function() for the functions add(), add(index), and set(index, value). This is because we are allowed to call things from the parent ArrayList by using super.
